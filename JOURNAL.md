I decided not to use the Raspberry Pi 5 and to use its compute module version instead to make it less bulky and more portable.
Also added the MIT license yesterday.
Found some footprints and stuff:
* [DF40 Connector](https://app.ultralibrarian.com/details/4330ca74-5bcc-11ea-8c00-0ad2c9526b44/Hirose/DF40C-100DS-0-4V-51-)
* [LCD Display](https://github.com/dishishshawn/kicad-st7735s-1.8in-tft) but I had to edit it to work with the [LCD I am using](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805953674718.html).
I also decided not to use joysticks and to replace it with a switch rotary encoder instead.
